# Simple Stereo Depth Estimation with YOLOv8 Tracking

> Real-time depth-aware object detection and tracking using stereo vision and YOLOv8. Built for robotics, computer vision research, and embedded systems.

This project presents a workflow that combines stereo vision depth estimation with object detection and tracking using YOLOv8. It is designed for real-time operation through a stereo camera system.

---

## Project Overview

### Steps:

1. Capture at least 30 images of a chessboard calibration pattern using a stereo camera to compute the camera intrinsics and the relative positioning of the two cameras (using the script [`stereo_capture.py`](stereo_capture.py)).

2. Perform Rectification to align the left and right images and reduce distortion.

3. Use YOLOv8 to detect objects in the left image of the stereo camera.

4. Create a Disparity Map from the rectified left and right images.

5. Use the disparity values to compute the object's distance (Z-axis in meters) based on the stereo camera geometry.

6. Display the results: The left image with bounding boxes around detected objects, including class info, distance, and object IDs.

## Core Components

### Stereo Calibration
- Load parameters from `stereo_calib_params.npz`
- Parameters used:
  - `cameraMatrix1`, `cameraMatrix2`
  - `distCoeffs1`, `distCoeffs2`
  - `R`, `T`

### Stereo Rectification
- Use `cv2.stereoRectify` and `initUndistortRectifyMap`
- Obtain rectified left and right images

### Depth Estimation
- Use `cv2.StereoSGBM_create` to create the disparity map
- Compute the object distance from the disparity using the equation:

```math
Z = (focal\_length \times baseline) / disparity
```

- Adjust the Z value with a scaling factor based on real-world distance provided by the user for improved accuracy in the specific use case

### YOLOv8 Detection
- Use Ultralytics YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt`)
- Detect and track objects of interest such as `person`, `bottle`, `cup`, `cell phone`, etc.

### Visualization
- Display bounding boxes with ID, class name, and distance
- Show the depth map in a colormap (Jet)
- Save the output video as `tracked_objects_output.mp4`

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage Notes
- A real stereo camera setup is required to capture both the left and right images in a single frame.
- The `baseline` and `focal_length` values should be referenced from calibration results to ensure accurate distance computation.
- Supports real-time processing and video saving.
